# About
A repository to test around with machine learning concepts. 

Projects will be trained in two ways:
- Manual implementation of basic algorithms (functions in `ML-toolbox.py`)
- TensorFlow / Keras

## ML-toolbox.py
My implementation of basic ML algorithms and functions to test my understanding of the subject

# About
This a WIP repository to test around with machine learning concepts based on Andrew Ng's courses in the `Machine Learning` and the `Deep Learning` specializations on coursera. 

Projects will be trained in two ways:
- Manual implementation of basic algorithms (functions in `ML-toolbox.py`)
- TensorFlow / Keras

## ML-toolbox.py
My implementation of basic ML algorithms and functions to test my understanding of the subject 

## :hammer_and_wrench: Environment Setup
```bash
pipenv install --ignore-pipfile --skip-lock
pipenv run jupyter notebook
```
